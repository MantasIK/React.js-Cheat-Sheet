# React.js-Cheat-Sheet

A reference sheet I created a while ago for new react developers

```App.js``` Contains most of the information regarding the React.js framework.

The **ClassComponent** is a boilerplate example for a stateful component in React.

The **FunctionalComponent** is a boilerplate example of a simple, stateless component in React.

**NameGiver** is used as an example of how events are drilled as props.

I encourage playing around with the repo and to use it as reference when starting out with React.
